-makes him jump one time after he drops off the prize platform if jump was pressed while he was on the prize platform
-Have an array of the different prizes and booby traps, then every so often it randomly choose a prize/booby trap
to have on the prize platform, could also generate the prize platform every so often and in a random x position.
-have a look at the mario game together to get ideas?
-make him travel along with the platforms, i.e. get stuck to the platform until it disappears?
-make him bigger if certain prize?
-make him smaller if goomba touch?
-can make the game rise in difficulty with speed of platforms and goombas?
