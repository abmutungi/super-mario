A simple take on Super Mario classic using only Javascript 

Features implemented:

- Proper use of RequestAnimationFrame
- Pause menu, that includes:
  - Continue

- A score board that displays the following metrics:
  - Countdown clock or Timer that will indicate the amount of time the player has until the game ends or the time that the game has been running
  - Score that will display the current score (XP or points)
